            <h3><u>AI & Automation</u></h3>
            <p>GPT-4, LangChain, Pinecone, vector DBs — I use these tools to build practical systems that think just
                enough to be useful.</p>

            <h3><u>Code, Interfaces & Websites</u></h3>
            <p>Python (FastAPI, Django), JavaScript (React), databases, schedulers, and queues — whatever fits the job.
            </p>
            <a href="/projects/?filter=code" class="button">See my projects on this</a>
            <h3><u>Integrations</u></h3>
            <p>REST, SOAP, OData, you name it. I wire things up so data gets where it needs to be, reliably.</p>

            <p>A lot of my work is invisible — the kind of backend logic that quietly makes everything click. I enjoy
                that. I like when systems hum in the background and people barely notice the machinery.</p>

            <p>Nice to meet you, I'm <span class="yellow"><b><i><u>Frank</u></i></b></span> — I build systems that make
                work smoother, faster, and a little less frustrating.</p>

            <p>By title, I'm a Software Engineer, an AI Automation Architect, and Integration Specialist. In practice,
                I'm someone who's spent the last few years knee-deep in real-world problems — connecting broken systems,
                stripping out manual overhead, and helping companies actually use the tech they pay for.</p>

            <p>I've worked with startups figuring things out, and with enterprises running full tilt. My projects
                usually land somewhere between automation, data flow, and custom apps — whether it's syncing thousands
                of Shopify orders with SAP S/4HANA, or building resume-screening tools that let recruiters focus on
                people, not parsing PDFs.</p>
