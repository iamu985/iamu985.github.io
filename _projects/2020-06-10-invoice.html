    <h2>Invoice Generator for Freelance Writers</h2>
    <img src="/assets/imgs/projects/invoice/1.png" alt="" srcset="">
    <p>
      In the world of freelancing—especially among writers paid per word—creating invoices is a tedious but necessary task. Writers must manually track word counts, associate them with specific articles, and format this data for clients. This application simplifies that process.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      With <strong>Invoice</strong>, generating invoices becomes a one-click operation.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
      Place all your articles in a single folder. Run <code>app.py</code>. A window will appear, prompting you to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter the path to the directory containing your articles.</li>
      <li>Set the destination folder for the generated invoice.</li>
      <li>Provide a name for the Excel invoice file.</li>
      <li>Optional flags: <code>title</code> and <code>dummy</code> (both default to <code>false</code>).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4><code>title</code> (bool, default: <code>false</code>)</h4>
    <p>
      Microsoft Word files can store internal titles. If this flag is <code>true</code>, the app attempts to extract this metadata and include it in the invoice.
    </p>
  
    <h4><code>dummy</code> (bool, default: <code>false</code>)</h4>
    <p>
      Freelancers are often assigned target word counts—200, 500, 1000, or more. Actual counts vary. This flag enables the app to <em>predict</em> the intended word count based on the actual total. The predicted count is shown under "Dummy Word Count."
    </p>
  
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>
      The application generates an Excel file with the following columns:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>File Name (.docx)</li>
      <li>Title (optional)</li>
      <li>Created Date</li>
      <li>Last Modified Date</li>
      <li>Actual Word Count</li>
      <li>Predicted Word Count (Dummy)</li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>
      This tool reduces friction in billing workflows, giving writers more time to focus on what matters—writing.
