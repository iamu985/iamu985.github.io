    <h1>My Journey as a Builder</h1>

    <p>
        I grew up in the hills of Darjeeling, a naturally curious kid with a habit of taking things apart just
        to understand how they worked. Whether it was an old radio or a gadget lying around the house, I’d
        dismantle it, study its inner workings, and attempt to piece it back together. That habit—break, study,
        rebuild—quietly shaped the way I think and work today.

        My introduction to programming came in Grade 6, when I stumbled upon QBASIC. While my classmates
        attended lectures, I’d spend hours in the school’s computer lab writing code. My first program was a
        simple student database system—nothing fancy, built without internet access and guided only by library
        books. But to me, it was a milestone. I’d created something functional from scratch. That feeling—what I
        call the “Creative High”—has stayed with me ever since.

        Programming has never been just technical for me—it’s a form of expression. Every challenge is a puzzle,
        and solving it feels more like an act of creativity than logic. That perspective is what continues to
        drive me: the freedom to build, to explore, to experiment.
    </p>

        Over the years, I’ve taken on a range of projects. One of the most formative was a POS system I helped
        develop for a local restaurant, working in a tight-knit team of three. We faced aggressive timelines,
        infrastructure limitations, and the pressure of real-world deployment—but we pulled it off. I also
        created a member database system for a regional association, and later went on to build integration
        packages, including one that bridged Shopify with SAP S/4 HANA.

    <p>
        That SAP integration was a turning point. It took three months of deep research to understand how OData
        services could be used for a real-time sync with Shopify. The problem wasn’t widely documented, and
        there were no examples to follow. But that’s what made the breakthrough meaningful—it was a problem no
        one else had solved in that way before.

        Lately, I’ve turned my attention to Artificial Intelligence. I’m especially interested in
        Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and the architecture behind them. AI feels like the next
        creative frontier—a space where I can apply everything I’ve learned, while continuing to grow.

        From cracking open radios in my childhood to building production-ready software today, my journey has
        always been shaped by curiosity and the thrill of making things work. Technology is constantly changing,
        and I’m here for the ride—still breaking, studying, and building, one problem at a time.
